# FizzBuzz exercise

With this exercise, you'll be practicing both `if...else` and `switch` conditional structures. You'll need to use the usual prompt and alert methods that you've been using in class.

##### Rules

- Prompt the user for a number
- If the number is divisible by 3, you should alert `Fizz!`
- If the number is divisible by 5, you should alert `Buzz!`
- If the number is divisible both by 3 **and** 5, you should alert `FizzBuzz!`
- Do the exercise both with `if...else` and `switch` conditional structures.

Example:

```javascript
const number = prompt('Enter a number') // User provides 15
// Check if number is divisible by 3, 5 or both
alert('FizzBuzz!')

```
