### Exercise 1 - Replace Text

- Replace that with a for loop that does the exact same thing
- Replace that with a while loop that does the exact same thing

```javascript
console.log("I have 0 sandwich");
console.log("I have 1 sandwich");
console.log("I have 2 sandwich");
console.log("I have 3 sandwich");
console.log("I have 4 sandwich");
console.log("I have 5 sandwich");
console.log("I have 6 sandwich");
console.log("I have 7 sandwich");
```


### Exercise 2 - Replace operation

- Replace that with a for loop that does the exact same thing
- Replace that with a while loop that does the exact same thing

```javascript
console.log("2 x 0 = 0");
console.log("2 x 1 = 2");
console.log("2 x 2 = 4");
console.log("2 x 3 = 6");
console.log("2 x 4 = 8");
console.log("2 x 5 = 10");
console.log("2 x 6 = 12");
console.log("2 x 7 = 14");
console.log("2 x 8 = 16");
console.log("2 x 9 = 18");
console.log("2 x 10 = 20");
```

### Exercise 2 - sum

 - Write a program to sum values of an array.
It isn't mandatory to use loops for this exercises.


```javascript
 let array = [2,5,8,10,100,3,6,20]
```

### Exercise 3 - Draw
Draw the next character with "for"
```
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
********
*********
```

### Exercise 4 - while not is for
    Review: While. Loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

- 4.1 Copy the following code and see how work
```javascript

    let number = 0;
    while(number !== 8){
        number = number +1
    }
    console.log(number+" is eight");
```


- 4.2 Copy the following code and see how work.
This code only finishes when you answer correctly.
```javascript

    let response = "";
    while(response !== "yes"){
       response = prompt("Is programming fun?");
    }
    console.log("yes, you have reason, programming is fun");
```

- 4.3. Now, you create your own code that only finishes when you want it.
Use while for create one code that only finish when answer correctly two
questions.


### 5. Array + "for".
 When you use loop and array, we obtain one powerful tool.

- First, you review about length.

- The **length** accessor property represents the length (in elements) of a typed array.

Example
```javascript
    let shoppingList = ["bananas","pineapple","water melon","fruit juice"];

    //show you have 4 in the shopping list.
    console.log("you have "+shoppingList.length+" in the shopping list.");
```

Now, you can use length with loops.
Copy the next code and understand how work.
```javascript
    let shoppingList = ["bananas","pineapple","water melon","fruit juice"];

    for(let i = 0; i < shoppingList.length; i++){
        console.log(i);
        console.log(shoppingList[i]);
        console.log("in my shopping list i have:"+shoppingList[i]);
    }

```

If you want you can carry on extra work. But for this finish this exercise only ned understand how
work this code.
