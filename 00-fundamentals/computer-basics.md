#Computer basics

When dealing with computers on a daily basis, you need to know that the keyboard and the mouse are your best friends. And if you want to be as fast as you can get, you should try to use your keyboard way more than the mouse. Why would you realy on two buttons when you have **10 fingers on one whole keyboard**?

We'll come back here later, but as an example, look at this [cheatsheet](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf), see how far you can get in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) just using your keyboard? Isn't that awesome?

This is great, but first, we need to get used to the most basic shortcuts we can use in a computer for the most basic tasks. These few shortcust will save you so much time you won't believe you didn't know them until now. Enjoy! :D

######Exercise

Practice with these commands as long as you need to get familiarized with them. Try to copy, cut and paste files, text fragments, whatever comes to your mind. Try to open files, close them, etc. Try to use all the commands at least once.
