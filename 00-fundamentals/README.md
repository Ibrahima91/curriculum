#Course fundamentals

In this section, you will find all the resources you need to start the web development course offered by Madrid For Refugees.

Within Course fundamentals, you will find three different topics:

###Computer basics

Don't try to memorize anything, just practice and you'll see how your muscles end up remember everything. ðŸ’ª

We'll also give you a brief introduction of how the web works. By the end of this section, you should be able to know what a client and a server are, what are they for and what are their similitudes and differences. You should know what an HTTP request is, what happens when you type your favourite website on google and why does it end up rendering on your browser of choice. If by the end of reading this section, these terms start making some sense to you, congratulations! You're on the right path. ðŸ˜ƒ

###Command line basics

Once you're done getting your way around your computer, we hope you're comfortable enough with your keyboard. This will help you with the next step in this section: The terminal ðŸ“Ÿ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ˜± . Worry you not, once you finish this section, you should be familiar with the most basic UNIX commands that will speed up your development in ways you just can't imagine at the moment of reading this.

###HTML and the web

Once you've mastered the previous sections, the moment you've been waiting for will be ready for you. You'll start getting your hands dirty and start building websites with HTML. You'll know your way around HTML tags, Doctypes, forms, and so much more. This is the fundamental of the web. Everything you can imagine that you see on your browser ends up being displayed in HTML, so you can imagine how powerful and how important it is that you know your way around it. Don't worry if it feels overwhelming at first. Practice is key, and once you start feeling comfortable, you'll see how you enjoy it more and more. This is just the beginning!
